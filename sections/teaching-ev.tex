{\footnotesize {\itshape Note}. The courses I taught were mainly about politics and research methods. Students’ evaluations substantiate my ability to teach: my average evaluation was 4.1/5.0 over five years considering 636 students’ surveys, 21 dimensions and a five-point Likert scale. My evaluations, on average, demonstrate that students were satisfied with my teaching performance.}
